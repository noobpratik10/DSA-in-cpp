#include <iostream>

/*Basic components of recursion

    Mandatory:-
        ->Base condition
        ->Recursive relation
    Optional:-
        ->Processing

    Two types of recursion:-
        ->Head type (Base condition, Processing, Recursive call)
        ->Tail type (Base condition, Recursive call, Processing)

    Space Complexity:-
        A lot!!

    Time Complexity:-
        O(n!)

    Why to use??
    -->Better for programmer

    When to use??
    -->When big problem can be divided into solving smaller pproblems repeatedly.
